Library Management System â€“ Project Report

1. Introduction
The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of books, members, and loan transactions in a library. Built using ASP.NET Core MVC and MongoDB, the system provides an intuitive interface for librarians to efficiently handle day-to-day library operations.

2. Objectives
- To provide a user-friendly platform for managing library resources.
- To automate the process of issuing and returning books.
- To maintain accurate records of books, members, and loan transactions.
- To demonstrate the use of modern web technologies and design patterns.

3. Technology Stack
- Backend: ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)
- Frontend: Razor Views, Bootstrap (for responsive UI)
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Other Tools: Entity Framework (if used), Visual Studio/VS Code

4. System Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:
- Models: Represent the data structure (Book, Member, Loan, LoanViewModel).
- Views: Razor pages for user interaction (CRUD forms, tables, modals).
- Controllers: Handle user requests, business logic, and data flow between models and views.
- Repositories: Abstract data access logic for MongoDB, promoting separation of concerns.

5. Database Design
- Book Collection:
  - Id (string/ObjectId)
  - Title (string)
  - Author (string)
  - ISBN (string)
  - PublishedYear (int)
  - AvailableCopies (int)
- Member Collection:
  - Id (string/ObjectId)
  - FullName (string)
  - Email (string)
  - PhoneNumber (string)
- Loan Collection:
  - Id (string/ObjectId)
  - BookId (string/ObjectId)
  - MemberId (string/ObjectId)
  - LoanDate (DateTime)
  - ReturnDate (DateTime?)

6. Core Features
6.1 Book Management
- Add, edit, delete, and list books.
- Validation for required fields and unique ISBNs.
- Display available copies.
6.2 Member Management
- Add, edit, delete, and list members.
- Validation for required fields, email, and phone number.
6.3 Loan Management
- Issue books to members (only if copies are available).
- Return books and update availability.
- View active loans with book titles and member names (using LoanViewModel).
6.4 User Interface
- Responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Tables for listing data.
- Forms for CRUD operations.
- Modals for confirmation actions (e.g., returning a book).

7. Implementation Highlights
- LoanViewModel: Used to join and display related data (Book Title, Member Name) in the loans table.
- Repository Pattern: Clean separation of data access logic for books, members, and loans.
- Validation: Both client-side and server-side validation for data integrity.
- Error Handling: User-friendly error messages and feedback for failed operations.

8. Challenges and Solutions
- Displaying Related Data:
  Solution: Created a LoanViewModel to join Book and Member data for display.
- File Lock Issues During Development:
  Solution: Ensured all running processes were stopped before rebuilding.
- Ensuring Data Consistency:
  Solution: Used validation and error handling in both controllers and views.

9. Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add search and filter functionality for books and members.
- Generate reports and analytics (e.g., most borrowed books).
- Send email notifications for overdue books.
- Improve UI/UX with AJAX and more interactive features.

10. Conclusion
The Library Management System successfully demonstrates the use of ASP.NET Core MVC and MongoDB to build a functional, maintainable, and user-friendly web application. The project covers all essential library operations and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements.
